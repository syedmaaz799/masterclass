 * never stored or incremented by a timer — so refreshing the page recomputes
 * the same value instead of resetting it, and the counter starts at
 * {@link INITIAL_REMAINING} the first time a visitor loads the page.
 *
 * These are pure/deterministic helpers — no React, no timers — so they are
 * testable and safe to import anywhere. The ticking hook (`useSeatCounter`)
